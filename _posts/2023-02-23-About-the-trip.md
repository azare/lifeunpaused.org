On February 25, 2023 my mother lost her short battle with Stage 4 Lung Cancer. Since the time of her death I've picked back up my love for motorcycling and discovered that I enjoy long solo motorcycle camping trips. This trip is to continue stepping out of my confort zone and push my physical and mental abilities. And what a better cause than to raise money for the American Cancer Society and I continue my journey.

## Overview

On Monday, July 24, 2023 I'll begin this journey from Saint Augustine, FL as I ride south to Key West for the official starting location. From there I'll ride north through the midwest states, through Canada heading towards Fairbanks, AK, from there I'll pickup the Dalton Highway where I'll complete stage 1 of my journey when I arrive at the oil fields of Pruhdoe Bay, AK.

After I get a few hours of rest I'll back down the Dalton Highway through Fairbanks, AK heading towards Whitehorse, Yukon, CA where I'll head north up towards the Dempster Highway to my stage 2 destination of Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, CA where I'll ride out to the Arctic Ocean and take a quick swim.

Stage 3 will begin the journey home as I head south to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Arches, Bryce Canyon, and Zion National Parks in Utah, Whitesands National Park in New Mexico, Big Bend National Park in Texas, and then head East towards Saint Augustine, FL to home.

The total trip shuold take around 5 weeks and cover over 14,000 miles.

## Challenges

I hope to complete 3 IronButt Challenges during my trip:
