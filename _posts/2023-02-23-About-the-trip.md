This trip is to raise money for the American Cancer Society in honor of my mother who passed away on Feb 25, 2022 from Stage 4 Lung Cancer.

## Overview

The trip will start in Saint Augustine, FL riding south to Key West for the official starting location. From there I'll ride north through the mid-west states, through Canada where I'll pickup the Dalton Highway for journey to the oil fields of Pruhdoe Bay, AK.
From there I'll ride southeast and pickup the Dempster Highway to ride to Tuktoyaktuk, where I'll ride to the Artic Ocean. After that the long journey home will begin as I ride south back into the United States for a tour of
a few National Parks as I head back to Saint Augustine, FL. The total trip should last around 5 weeks and I'll ride over 13,000 miles.

## Challenges

I hope to complete 3 IronButt Challenges during my trip.
.1 1000 miles in 24hrs
