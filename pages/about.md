This is site is to share my travel adventures, primarily on my motorcycle, but I'm sure will extend to other forms of travel in the future. The *unpausing* of my life started with the loss of my parents in early 2022. I don't think it matters how old you are, the loss of a parent is always difficult. I started to reflect on my own mortality at that point and took a look at how i was living my life. Why did I stop doing many of the things I enjoyed so much when I was younger. Well a lot of the reason was family, I raised 3 children over those 25 yrs and just didn't have the free time. But now they're all young adults and self supportive. I found myself with much more free time on my hands. In early 2022 I rediscovered my love of two wheeled motorsports. I decided to trade in my 2006 Harley Davidson Road Glide and go back to one of the bikes I first owned as an adult, for a 2022 BMW R11250GS Adventure. In 2022 I was fortunate to take many long trips on it covering over 10,000 miles. After coming home from each trip I'd miss the feeling of adventure and being out in nature. After doing some research for my next destination I attended a talk of another local rider tht did the Key West to Pruhdoe Bay, AK trip with his brother-in-law. I spent the next 3 months doing research and doing the trip myself, as a solo rider. After speaking with others who've done the trip I felt confident this was doable for me. I want to do it not only to push myself beyond my comfort limits, but to also reflect on my parents and how they raised me to never be afraid to try something new and venture to new destinations for adventure. So this trip is also for them and to help raise money of the American Cancer Society in honor of my mother who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer and lost her battle on Feb 25, 2022.
