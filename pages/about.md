This is site is to share my travel adventures, primarily on my motorcycle, although I'm sure it will extend to other forms of travel in the future. The *unpausing* of my life started with the loss of my parents in early 2022. I don't think it matters how old you are, the loss of a parent is always difficult. I started to reflect on my own mortality at that point and took a look at how I was living my life, which lead to asking myself why did I stop doing many of the things I enjoyed so much when I was younger. Well a lot of the reason was family, raising 3 children over those 25 yrs and just not having the free time. Now my children all young adults and self supportive and leading their own lives. Because of that I found myself with more free time on my hands.

In early 2022 I rediscovered my love of two wheeled motorsports. I decided to trade in my 2006 Harley Davidson Road Glide for a 2022 BMW R11250GS Adventure, the adventure bike was one of the first bikes I owned as an adult. During that year I was fortunate to take many long trips covering over 10,000 miles. But after coming home from each trip I'd miss the feeling of adventure and being out in nature. I started doing research for my next destination and during a bike club meeting, I attended a talk by a local rider talking about his ride from Key West to Pruhdoe Bay, AK with his brother-in-law. That trip seemed like a good way to push my comfort zone further, so I spent the next 3 months researching the route, points of interest, how to pack and prepare, and what are some of the dangers to be prepared for.

After speaking with others who've done the trip I felt confident this was doable for me. I've decided to do the trip solo and maximize wild camping as much as possible to push myself beyond my comfort limits. My goal is to camp everynight with the exception of Key West, a stop by my sons house in St. Louis, and at Pruhdoe Bay. My parents raised me to never be afraid to try something new and venture to new destinations for adventure. So this trip is also for them and to help raise money of the American Lung Association in honor of my mother who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer and lost her battle on Feb 25, 2022 and my father who passed away on December 15, 2021 of complications from COPD.
